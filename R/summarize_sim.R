#' @title Summarize key outbreak metrics from a simulation
#' @description
#' Extract headline diagnostics from SIRS simulations: peak infected proportion
#' and its day, peak daily incidence (count) and its day, and the final recovered
#' proportion. Works for **deterministic single-run** outputs or **stochastic
#' single-population, multi-run** outputs.
#'
#' @param sim A simulation result list. See **Details** for the required fields.
#'
#' @return A `data.frame` with one row per simulation path and columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{sims}{Simulation index (1 for deterministic case).}
#'   \item{peak_I}{Maximum infected **proportion** over time.}
#'   \item{peak_I_day}{Time index (day) of `peak_I`.}
#'   \item{peak_incidence}{Maximum daily **count** of new infections.}
#'   \item{peak_incidence_day}{Time index (day) of `peak_incidence`.}
#'   \item{final_R}{Recovered/immune **proportion** at the last day.}
