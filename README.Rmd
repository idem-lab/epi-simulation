# SIRS Modeling Simulator

Fast, clear, and reproducible SIRS model simulation for deterministic and stochastic scenarios, including multi-population runs, summary tables, and publication-quality plots.

## What is SIRS model?

The SIRS model is a type of mathematical model used in epidemiology to describe the dynamics of an infectious disease in a population by dividing it into three compartments: **Susceptible**, **Infectious**, and **Recovered**.
![](pre/images/SIRS.png)

A simple continuous-time form is: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta SI + \omega R\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &=  \beta SI - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &=  \gamma I - \omega R\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where
: $\beta(t)$ is the transmission rate
: $\gamma$ is recovery rate
: $\omega$ rate at which the immune in R becomes susceptible again.(R → S)
: $N = S + I + R$ is the total population size.


## Why do we need epidemic simulation?

# Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("idem-lab/epi-simulation")

library(epi-sumulation)

```

# What's inside?

| Category | Function(s) | Description |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Simulators** | `simulate_sirs_det()` | Deterministic single population. |
|  | `simulate_sirs_stoch()` | Stochastic single population (many rounds). |
|  | `simulate_sirs_multi()` | Deterministic multi-population. |
|  | `simulate_sirs_multi_stoch()` | Stochastic multi-population. |
| **Plotting** | `plot_sir_diag()` | Single-pop SIR/overlay/incidence views. |
|  | `plot_stoch()` | Stochastic ribbons/lines & incidence. |
|  | `plot_multi()` | Multi-pop S/I/R/incidence (combined or faceted). |
|  | `plot_dashboard()` + `arrange_dashboard()` | Build a multi-panel dashboard. |
| **Summaries & helpers** | `summarize_sim()` | Headline outbreak metrics (peaks, final sizes, etc.). |
|  | `make_beta()` | Time-varying β (e.g., seasonal cosine). |
|  | `to_tidy()` | Coerce outputs to a tidy long table (time, group, sim, state, value). |

# Example

Here are some examples of how to use the package functions. For full example please check the demo it is user-friendly walkthroughs.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Wil delete this loading function after turning into package
R.utils::sourceDirectory("R/")
```

This is an exmaple for a deterministic single-population SIRS simulation:
```{r}
n_times <- 60
pop <- 100000
I_init <- 10
beta <- 0.75
gamma <- 1/7
omega <- 1/30

sim_1 <- simulate_sirs_det(n_times, pop, I_init, beta, gamma, omega)
sim_1$I
```

# Plotting

```{r}
plot_sir_diag(sim_1, which = "sir")
```
